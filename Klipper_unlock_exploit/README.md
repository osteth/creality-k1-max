How to get Fluidd web interface on the Creality K1:
- Use the K3D’s K1 Exploit to reset the root password to "creality" I have not yet tested this but you may be able to skip this step and use the default password instead.
 default password:
    ```
    0755cxsw$888
    ```
### Exploit steps:
 1. Open K3D_k1_exploun.html in browser. 
 2. Enter the IP address of your printer. 
 #### method A:
- Upload shadow.gcode to the printer as though it were a print file. 
- click "method A" button on the exploit html page.  

### method B:
- click "method B" button, this should automatically upload the shadow.gcode and complete the exploit to change the password automatically. 

### Version note:
I beleive thet this only works on version 1.9.15?? the HTML page also has a button on the page to allow rolling back the firmware to the appropriate version. The name of the file is 1.9.22 but I believe that it is 1.9.15 renamed with a higher version name so that the printer will allow "upgrade" essentially rolling back to 1.9.15

 2. Connect to the printer via SSH (root + “creality”) or (root + "0755cxsw$888") if you didnot complete the exploit

Enter the following commands to move the moonraker.cong
```
cp /usr/share/moonraker/moonraker.conf /usr/data/printer_data/config/
```

Next edit the S50nginx file

```
vi /etc/init.d/S50nginx
```
and using the commands below, remove the comments from the lines:
'''
# mkdir -p /var/log/nginx /var/tmp/nginx
# start-stop-daemon -S -x "$NGINX" -p "$PIDFILE” 
```
 - NOTE: Vi editor commands:
 - “I” is edit mode
 - “:w” is save
 - “:q” is quit
 ```
 
 next edit the s56moonraker_service file
 ```
vi /etc/init.d/S56moonraker_service”
 ```
 remove the comment from the line:
```
# start (If there is one)
```
 6. Restart the printer
 7. Type printers IP address + “:4408” to access fluidd frontend


## *Notice*
I did not come up with any of this I have just translated from russian to english and compiled the files from telegram to gitlab to better server US users.
